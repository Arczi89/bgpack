   <description>A party meets for a game in the casino. After the players determine how much money can be won at the casino tables they play their character cards and move their pawns to a casino table. The payout can be multiplied or lost to card sharks. In the beginning the stakes are low but they increase from round to round. In Vabanque, if you carefully watch the others, and guess their bluffs, you can win a lot. The player with the most money after four rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

こういうのが盛り上がれる人とやる場合はいいかも
インタラクションのみで、理詰めで考えても仕方がないゲームなので、そういう点を許容できるかどうかで評価がかわってくると思う
ツッコミどころ満載で、システムの欠点みたいなものはあるのだけど、遊んで面白いかどうかってところだけ見ると面白いんだよね
だからと言ってはなんなんだけど、どのゲームにも言えることなのだけどこういうのを楽しめる人と是非遊んでもらいたいな</comment>

      <comment username="cbdarden" rating="2">What a truly awful game.  No meaningful decisions to be made, no enjoyment to be had.</comment>
      <comment username="Arnott" rating="3">Too easy to fall behind with no chance of catching up, and even if you do keep pace (or lead), the big money final round will determine the winner, regardless, making most of your earlier moves kind of pointless.  And since the last round has a good deal of randomness to it, the whole game is kind of pointless.</comment>
      <comment username="wlam" rating="3">Played a few times on BSW (with 3-4 players). This game probably has something more than pure, random guessing. Too bad I could not find it yet. Still, as it is short enough and on BSW, I might try it again some day.</comment>
      <comment username="robartin" rating="3">Interesting but kind of strange game.  After playing it a couple of times, it seems that the only thing that matters is doing well in the last round or so.  This makes one wonder why the earlier rounds exist at all...</comment>
      <comment username="ExeterGeek" rating="3">Just didn&#039;t work for me</comment>
      <comment username="maddiedogson" rating="3">don&#039;t plan. do whatever you want without thinking and see who wins</comment>
      <comment username="astroglide" rating="3">disappointed.  the box is a nice size, the bits are absolutely excellent.  i&#039;m not sure why english rules weren&#039;t included with the game, but they&#039;re available on bgg and very simple.  the game escalates up 4 rounds of betting and bluffing.  it doesn&#039;t seem like the earlier rounds matter at all barring a bizarrely excessive payout, and the whole game feels like hoity toity with less content.  i would have never predicted saying that about a game.  i know they&#039;re targeting light and fun, but it was more like we had fun in spite of the game.  i do love the rule about changing seats for turn order, though.</comment>
      <comment username="rseater" rating="3">both bad and forgettable</comment>
      <comment username="moramis" rating="3">Vasel rec&#039;d. Pretty terrible at 3p. I&#039;d like to try this again with more.</comment>
      <comment username="ptm_junk" rating="3">wow... pretty bad bluffing game</comment>
      <comment username="BrunoDeVries" rating="3">Complete randomness. Utter frustration.</comment>
      <comment username="mkgray" rating="3.5">I really want to like this, and at some level I think I do, but every time I play it everyone else despises it so, I doubt I&#039;ll bring it out often because I don&#039;t want to inflict this on others.</comment>
      <comment username="MarkEJohnson" rating="4">Even though I like some other games that are mostly about group-think (e.g.Hol&amp;#039;s der Geier family), this one didn&amp;#039;t appeal beyond the nice bits.</comment>
      <comment username="Baldboy_1" rating="4">Played this on BSW a few times but never got into it. Another paper/rock/scissors type game that seems even more random then most. This one just isn&amp;#039;t my thing.</comment>
      <comment username="brendanf" rating="4">A light and silly bluffing game.  For me it doesn&#039;t quite work, because there&#039;s just not information on which to guess what your opponent might be up to, so it ends up seeming like dumb luck.</comment>
      <comment username="5th Beatles" rating="4">reviewed on my blog.</comment>
      <comment username="sdiberar" rating="4">Not bad, but the blind-bidding/groupthink guesswork is just not my idea of great gaming.</comment>
      <comment username="akapastorguy" rating="4">Great components... just so-so bluffing game.</comment>
      <comment username="dr glaze et al" rating="4">[Colovini / Faidutti] Easy to explain, gorgeous bits, actual tension, and handles up to six with ease. It is entirely too much about groupthink though. Playing with bluffers would be much more interesting than playing with logical players, which is unfortunately my entire group.</comment>
      <comment username="Armadi" rating="4">Components are nice.  Not much game here.</comment>
      <comment username="TaliaIsabelle" rating="4">Another blind guessing game (in the same vein as Basari or Hoity Toity) that I just don&#039;t enjoy.  If you like bluffing games then give this a try, but if you&#039;re like me and find bluffing games more like completely random games (along the lines of Candy Land or Chutes &amp; Ladders) then you can skip this one and count yourself lucky.</comment>
      <comment username="Kosmonaut" rating="4">Pure bluffing game with no extra elements or twists to make the game more interesting. </comment>
      <comment username="alzsara" rating="4">Players seed different tables with money, then each player plays a cheat card, a doubler card and a bluff card face down across different tables. And here&#039;s the skillful part ... you try and guess where opponent&#039;s didn&#039;t play their cheat cards and move to that table (otherwise they&#039;ll get your money) AND you try and guess where opponents would like to go and place your cheat card there (so you&#039;ll get their money), hoping opponents will think it&#039;s your bluff card. Oh, what skill, what fun!  Repeat for 4 rounds, with each round having more money so that the early rounds are fairly meaningless. As you can gather, not my kind of game. It&#039;s kind of fun seeing the cards revealed and whether you guessed right or not, but there&#039;s not much else pulling me back. </comment>

      <comment username="Exilas" rating="5">The bluff factor is quite fun, but the game is nearly uncontrollable. There are way better games to play.</comment>
      <comment username="Ajax" rating="5">Excellent components...except for the cards: they&#039;re weird.  Not a bad game, to be sure, but I&#039;d rather play any number of bluffing games for the time investment.</comment>
      <comment username="pulla" rating="5">Boring and randomish.</comment>
      <comment username="garg" rating="5">After one play: elegant idea and quick gameplay (something I like). It seems that much depends on the players - have to test it a few times more.

EDIT: the number of tactics is extremely limited. For sale.</comment>
      <comment username="kystas" rating="5">Nothing special here. Easy to play, but offers very little strategic choices. Filler.</comment>
