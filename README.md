## Quick Start

### Requirements

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for backend)
- **Node.js 18+** (for frontend development)

### Development Setup (Recommended)

**One command to run the entire project:**

```bash
# Linux/Mac - Backend in Docker (default)
./start-dev.sh

# Linux/Mac - Backend locally (requires Java 17)
./start-dev.sh --local

# Windows - Backend in Docker (default)
start-dev.bat

# Windows - Backend locally (requires Java 17)
start-dev.bat --local
```

**Stop the application:**

```bash
# Linux/Mac
./stop-dev.sh

# Windows
stop-dev.bat
```

**Application will be available at:**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (local development)
- Backend: http://localhost:8080 (Docker container or local)

### Backend Options

**Docker Backend (Default):**

- No Java installation required
- Consistent environment
- Slower startup time

**Local Backend:**

- Requires Java 17 (included in `tools/jdk-17.0.2/`)
- Faster startup and debugging
- Direct access to logs

### Local Development (without Docker)

**One command (recommended):**

```bash
# Linux/Mac
./start-app.sh

# Windows
start-app.bat
```

**Or manually:**

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

**Stop:**

```bash
# Linux/Mac
./stop-app.sh

# Windows - press Ctrl+C in start-app.bat window
```

## 🔍 Game Filtering System

BGPack provides comprehensive filtering capabilities to help you find the perfect games for your group. The filtering system supports both **exact matching** and **overlap matching** for player counts, giving you flexibility in how you search for games.

### Filter Types

#### Player Count Filters

**Min Players** and **Max Players** filters allow you to find games suitable for your group size. The system supports two modes:

**Non-Exact Mode (Default):**

- Shows games that **support** the specified player range
- Example: Filtering for 3-4 players shows games like:
  - `2-4 players` (supports 3-4) ✅
  - `3-4 players` (supports 3-4) ✅
  - `1-5 players` (supports 3-4) ✅
  - `4-6 players` (supports 4) ✅

**Exact Mode:**

- Shows only games with **exactly** the specified player range
- Example: Filtering for 3-4 players (exact) shows only:
  - `3-4 players` (exact match) ✅
  - `2-4 players` (not exact) ❌
  - `1-5 players` (not exact) ❌

**Toggle between modes using the "Exact player count match" checkbox.**

#### Playing Time Filters

**Min Playing Time** and **Max Playing Time** filters help you find games that fit your available time:

- Example: `30-60 minutes` shows games with playing time between 30 and 60 minutes

#### Age Filters

**Min Age** filters games by recommended minimum age:

- Example: `12+` shows games recommended for ages 12 and above

#### Rating Filters

**Min Rating** filters games by BGG rating:

- Example: `7.0+` shows games with BGG rating of 7.0 or higher

#### Year Filters

**Year From** and **Year To** filters games by publication year:

- Example: `2010-2020` shows games published between 2010 and 2020

### Filtering Examples

**Example 1: Family Game Night**

```
Min Players: 4
Max Players: 4
Min Age: 8
Max Playing Time: 60
Min Rating: 7.0
```

Result: Games for exactly 4 players, suitable for ages 8+, under 60 minutes, with good ratings.

**Example 2: Large Group Games**

```
Min Players: 6
Exact Match: OFF (non-exact mode)
```

Result: All games that support 6+ players (6-8, 6-10, 1-10, etc.)

**Example 3: Quick Games for Any Group Size**

```
Max Playing Time: 30
Min Rating: 7.5
```

Result: Quick games (≤30 min) with excellent ratings, regardless of player count.

### Filter Behavior

- **Multiple filters** work together with AND logic (all conditions must be met)
- **Empty filters** are ignored (no filtering applied)
- **Sorting** works on filtered results
- **Pagination** applies to filtered results
- **Real-time filtering** - results update as you change filter values

### API Filter Parameters

All filters are available via the REST API:

```bash
# Player count filters
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/games?minPlayers=2&maxPlayers=4&exactPlayerFilter=true"

# Playing time filters
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/games?minPlayingTime=30&maxPlayingTime=90"

# Rating and age filters
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/games?minRating=7.0&minAge=12"

# Year filters
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/games?yearFrom=2020&yearTo=2023"

# Combined filters
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/games?minPlayers=3&maxPlayers=5&minPlayingTime=45&maxPlayingTime=90&minRating=7.5"
```

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios for API communication
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Prettier for code formatting

**Backend:**

- Spring Boot 3.2 with Java 17
- Spring Security for authentication and CORS
- Spring Web for REST API
- Spring Data MongoDB for persistence
- Spring Cache for performance optimization
- Lombok for code simplification
- Jackson for XML parsing
- Google Java Format + Checkstyle for code quality

**Infrastructure:**

- MongoDB for data persistence
- Docker & Docker Compose for containerization
- Nginx for frontend serving
- Maven for build management

### Docker Configuration

The application is fully containerized:

**Production (`docker-compose.yml`):**

- Backend: OpenJDK 17, port 8080
- Frontend: Multi-stage build with Nginx
- Health checks and dependencies

**Development (`docker-compose.dev.yml`):**

- Hot reload with volume mounts
- Debug support
- Development servers

### Application Flow

```
Frontend (port 3000) → Nginx → Backend (port 8080) → MongoDB
                                           ↓
                                      BGG API
```

### Data Flow

1. **Game Search**: Frontend → Backend → BGG API → Filtered Results
2. **Collection Fetch**: Frontend → Backend → BGG API → User's Games
3. **List Management**: Frontend → Backend → MongoDB → Persistent Storage
4. **Caching**: Spring Cache stores frequently accessed data for performance

### Code Quality

The project includes automated code formatting and quality checks:

- **Pre-commit hook** - automatically formats code before commits
- **Frontend**: Prettier for TypeScript/JavaScript/CSS formatting
- **Backend**: Google Java Format + Checkstyle for Java code quality

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### BGG API Integration Issues

If the application returns mock data instead of real BGG data, check these configurations:

#### SSL/TLS Certificate Issues

**Problem**: BGG API returns `null` responses due to SSL certificate validation failures.

**Solution**: The backend is configured to ignore SSL certificate issues:

```java
// In BggApiClient.java
.trustManager(io.netty.handler.ssl.util.InsecureTrustManagerFactory.INSTANCE)
```

#### Redirect Handling

**Problem**: BGG API redirects from `www.boardgamegeek.com` to `boardgamegeek.com`.

**Solution**: Enable automatic redirects:

```java
// In BggApiClient.java
.followRedirect(true)
```

#### User-Agent Requirements

**Problem**: BGG API blocks requests with custom User-Agent strings.

**Solution**: Use standard browser User-Agent:

```java
// In BggApiClient.java
.defaultHeader("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36...")
```

#### Rate Limiting

**Problem**: BGG API blocks requests that exceed rate limits.

**Solution**: Configure appropriate rate limiting in `application.yml`:

```yaml
bgg:
  api:
    rate-limit: 1.0 # 1 request per second
    max-requests-per-hour: 3600 # 3600 requests per hour
```

#### CORS Configuration

**Problem**: Frontend cannot access backend API.

**Solution**: Configure CORS in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  web:
    cors:
      allowed-origins: "http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000"
      allowed-methods: "GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS"
      allowed-headers: "*"
      allow-credentials: true
```

### Common Issues

1. **Backend returns mock data**: Check BGG API configuration and SSL settings
2. **CORS errors**: Verify CORS configuration in `application.yml`
3. **Rate limiting**: Ensure rate limits are not exceeded
4. **SSL errors**: Backend is configured to ignore SSL certificate issues
